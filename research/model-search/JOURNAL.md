# Model-search journal

Research-only search for a better ETA model. Branch `claude/model-search`.
Harness: `harness.py` (prep/run), arms in `arms.py`, live features in
`features_live.py`. Results JSON per arm in `results/`.

## Fixed day set (DS1)
- Pipeline days: 2026-09-07 .. 2026-09-21 (`scripts/run_pipeline.py --date … --parallel 2`).
  Cloud box = 4 cores / 15.7 GB; `--parallel 3` OOM-killed (each worker ~4.7 GB
  RSS and still growing at ~15 min) and a BrokenProcessPool loses every day, so
  use 2. Disk is wiped between runs → every run regenerates; keep the set small.
- Train: 2026-09-07 .. 2026-09-18 (12 days). Test: 2026-09-19 (Sat), 09-20 (Sun),
  09-21 (Mon).
- Features built per day against `get_gtfs_for_date(day)` (static archive
  snapshots 2026-08-24, 2026-09-04 cover this range), sampled per day by
  hashing (vehicle_id, snapshot_ts) → whole snapshots kept, 10% default.
- Baseline arm = `src/train.py` recipe (features, sanity filters, bad routes,
  train-only route×hour priors, hour sample weights, HGBT hyper-params).

## Known from repo history (don't redo)
- Segment-additive link-time model (scripts/compare_models.py, 2026-08-14) loses
  to direct HGBT at every horizon (170 vs 139s); blends worse than A alone.
